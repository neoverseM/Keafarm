Kea Farm is an NFT AgTech Game where anyone can be a farmer and investor at the same time. It was born from the desire to put in close connection the world of NFTs with real agriculture.

Our Mission:
It was built as a fun and educational way to introduce the world to agriculture and blockchain technology.
And the most important thing to solve here is food security. 
Malaysia has not yet reached the level of self-sufficiency for basic food and does not produce enough food for its population. As reported in the Agrofood Statistics 2019 of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industries (MAFI), Malaysia's self-sufficiency level of major food commodities for 2019 such as rice, vegetables, fruits, beef and liquid milk stood at 63 per cent, 44.4 per cent, 78.2 per cent, 22.3 per cent and 63 per cent respectively.

Our vission:
We believe in empowering our players and giving them economic opportunities.
We believe in a future where everyone can become a farmer to create own food.  Most of all, we have a dream that our platform can change the agriculture world forever.
Kea Farm is a new type of game that rewards players for the time and effort they spend both playing the game and growing the ecosystem.
Game resources and items are tokenized, meaning they can be sold to anyone, anywhere on open peer-to-peer markets.
Kea Farm is a real money economy. You can think it as a nation with a real agriculture economy.
